## **Overview**

This project explores the development of an AI-driven **Image-Based Recommendation System** leveraging vector search and embeddings. The system is designed to recommend visually similar products based on input images by utilizing advanced deep learning techniques for feature extraction and similarity matching.

The model has been trained and tested on a dataset consisting of multiple fashion product categories, such as shirts, dresses, pants, sunglasses, handbags, and more. This approach ensures high-quality recommendations tailored to user preferences and behavior.

## **Key Features**

1. **Feature Extraction using Embeddings**:  
   Leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to extract high-dimensional feature embeddings from product images.

2. **Vector Search**:  
   Employing **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)** search techniques to efficiently retrieve similar product images based on cosine similarity or Euclidean distance in the embedding space.

3. **End-to-End Pipeline**:  
   The recommendation system includes image preprocessing, feature extraction, vector storage, and real-time recommendation delivery.

4. **Scalable Architecture**:  
   Using vector databases such as **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, or **FAISS** for efficient indexing and querying of embeddings.

5. **Customizable Categories**:  
   The system supports classification into predefined categories such as shirts, shoes, sunglasses, and more, which can be expanded with additional datasets.

## **Workflow**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:  
   The dataset containing product images is cleaned, labeled, and preprocessed for model training.

2. **Feature Embedding Generation**:  
   Pre-trained models are used to extract feature vectors representing the visual characteristics of each image.

3. **Indexing with Vector Search**:  
   Feature vectors are indexed in a vector database for fast retrieval.

4. **Recommendation**:  
   When a user inputs an image, the system computes its embedding and performs a similarity search in the vector database to return the most visually similar products.

5. **Evaluation**:  
   The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP).
